# SUI-NURBS: Speed-Up the Intersection between Two NURBS Surfaces

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for reimplementing the algorithm in Python for speeding up the intersection between two NURBS surfaces. The original algorithm was proposed by [Lin et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6616551/) in 2014.
